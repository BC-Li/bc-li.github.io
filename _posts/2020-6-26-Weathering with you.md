Emm...
Today I watched "Weathering with you", which I'm longing to watch for a while.

(Why would I always make the reviews at midnight, or... should I make it tomorrow?)

Firstly I am very very regretted to looked at the reviews by others on douban and I encountered with some spoilers. After that with the spoilers the experence was not good enough. So be careful next time when reading the reviews before watching it QAQ

The second thing is that the points that made me cry were not as many as that in "Your Name". Probably because I watched it with lights on tonight and it maybe a little bit hard for me to cry out with all lights on... (but that day I didn't so the touching story really made me cry). but when I got to washing room I found my eyes red in front of the mirror.

Next thing is, as for the story itself, personally I think the whole logic in story-telling is a little bit farfetched but that's OK for me. As for the points that make you conflict... XD just ignore them, it's just a movie after all. If it can touch your heard and make you feel warm, the aim is achieved, I think.

The fourth thing is that through the whole movie I didnt find the stinger of "your name" in the film! (maybe I should rewatch "your name" for another 5 times XD) I finally found it in Bilibili.

The last thing is, I confess I just love the story by Shinkai Makoto. Even he writes another 10 stories totally the same as this or the story that "you guys think much worse", I STILL LOVE IT. I just like the sweet love story!
