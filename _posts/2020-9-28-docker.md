Use docker as your virtual environment for your project testing

## How I get to know Docker

Emm... maybe through Zhihu or something else, I don't remember that exactly.

Below are some more important things, I think.

## What is Docker?

Before we go to the world of Docker, we should know the concept of "container" first.

### [Container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container)

> A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

You can find more in the website shown above in title **Container**.

## What can Docker do?

> **Docker** is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and deploy it as one package.
