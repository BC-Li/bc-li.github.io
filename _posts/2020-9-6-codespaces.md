I almost forgot when I received the E-mail from GitHub, saying that I'm off the waiting list and I'm able to use one of the beta features called "Codespaces" released on May by GitHub Satellite. 

I'm more than delighted to get that for it's a feature that I've been longing for so far. So I excitedly clicked it immediately and it run as imagined.

IT IS AMAZING!

That means from now on I can use every one of my devices no matter what system it is based on such as Android/IOS because Codespaces is not running on my device, but a remote server. And the UI is the same as Visual Studio Code. The loading speed is a little bit slower than my laptop but it is still rather fast. Every extension runs like it is on a local environment. To get it running you just click "Codespaces" on GitHub website, which is pretty convenient for me.

I've been thinking to buy an iPad and a keyboard case for it so that I don't need to take my big, heavy gaming laptop to classes every day, ending up typing one line "`#import <stdio.h>`".
