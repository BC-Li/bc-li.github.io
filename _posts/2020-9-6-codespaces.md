Codespaces: An cloud IDE made by GitHub & Microsoft, previously named "Visual Studio Online".

I almost forgot when I received an E-mail from GitHub, saying that I'm off the waiting list and I'm able to use one of the beta features called "Codespaces" released on May by GitHub Satellite.

I'm more than delighted to get that, for it's a feature that I've been longing for. So I excitedly clicked it immediately, and it run as imagined.

IT IS AMAZING!

That means from now on I can use every one of my devices, no matter what system it is based on, such as Android/IOS because Codespaces is actually not running on my device, but a remote server. And the UI is the same as Visual Studio Code. The loading speed is a little bit slower than my laptop but it is still rather fast. Every extension runs as if it is on a local environment. To get it running I just need to click "Codespaces" button on GitHub website, which is pretty convenient for me.

After experiencing it, I've been thinking to buy an iPad and a keyboard case for it, so that I don't need to take my big, heavy gaming laptop to classes every day, always ending up typing one line "`#import <stdio.h>`" and it runs out of power.
