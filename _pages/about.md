## Relaxations

In my spare time I spent sometime on music, books, movies and games.

They somehow have become my remedies in my tough times. And I also have an opportunity to think about something I may never have a chance to.

For more information about my favorites, you can check them at [TurboRocket's Personal Notion Space](https://www.notion.so/bochengli/TurboRocket-s-Personal-Notion-Space-cee2c62aff584b298ae7088706c3d28e).



## Why "Forest Zone"?
  The name *Forest Zone* is originated from a location in an RPG game named *NieR:Automata* , one of my favorite games this year.

> *NieR: Automata* is a 2017 action role-playing video game developed by Platinum Games and published by Square Enix. It is a sequel to the 2010 video game *NieR*, itself a spin-off and sequel of the *Drakengard* series.
