## Why "Forest Zone"?
  The name *Forest Zone* is originated from a location in an RPG game named *NieR:Automata* , one of my favorite games this year.

[^NieR:Automata]: *NieR: Automata* is a 2017 action role-playing video game developed by Platinum Games and published by Square Enix. It is a sequel to the 2010 video game *NieR*, itself a spin-off and sequel of the *Drakengard* series.
