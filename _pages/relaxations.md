## Music

I'm enthusiastic in music and I spend much time on it.

Normally my favorite music styles are:

* EDM 
* Pop 
* R&B 
* Rap

You can also take a look at my favorite songs in Netease Cloud Music: [TurboRocket](https://music.163.com/#/user/home?id=133002715).

## Games

I like ARPG games and FPS games, but I may not play that often. 

Some games I love a lot:

{% include gallery id="gallery2" caption=" Call of Duty Series & Witch Spring 4 on Android platform" %}
